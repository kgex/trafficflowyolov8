# TrafficFlow 

![TrafficFlow Logo](https://github.com/kgex/trafficflowyolov8/logo.png)

The Traffic Flow project at KGISL utilizes cutting-edge technologies like DeepSort for precise object tracking and ANPR/OCR for license plate recognition. This revolutionizes vehicle monitoring on campus by extracting vehicle images with DeepSort, analyzing them through ANPR/OCR for accurate vehicle numbers and counts, and ensuring real-time data processing and precise movement tracking. Integrating MQTT and Thingsboard establishes a swift data transmission system, facilitating instant vehicle counts, Vehicle type, Number plate value, and Vehicle color along with a timestamp. This significantly enhances safety measures and optimizes traffic flow at KGISL, contributing to a smarter, more secure educational campus.
